# MqttClient4IoT

A simple demonstration of how to use MQTTnet library to create a .Net application to exchange messages between an IoT device and a Supervisor application.

You can use included docker-compose to build the working solution with mocked device or build Mqtt.Device project on a Raspberry PI with Sense Hat to send data from real sensors to MQTT Broker.
